# Spark in Action, 2nd edition - chapter 99

Welcome to Spark in Action, 2nd edition, chapter 99. This chapter is about all the stuff that we'd love to have in the book, but we could not because it is already more than 600 pages.

## Labs

### Lab #100
This lab mixes machine learning and data quality to predict the revenues of a party of 40 people at a restaurant.

Notes: 
 1. Due to renaming the packages to match more closely Java standards, this project is not in sync with the book's MEAP prior to v10 (published in April 2019).
 2. As of MEAP v14, we have introduced Scala and Python examples (published in October 2019).
